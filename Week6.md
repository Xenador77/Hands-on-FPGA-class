# Week 6: Getting into the real world
- Digital Architecture: How to put a system together?
  - Concept of a digital bus
    - Why busses?
    - Wishbone
    - AMBA
  - Control path & Data path:
    - Common data bus
    - Dedicated point-point links

- FPGA specifics: Beyond the basics
  - Pin Constraints
  - Timing constraints
  - Place and Route
  - Coding for FPGA's




## Material

  - [Wishbone Specification](https://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf)
  - [Valid-Ready Protocol](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs150/Documents/Interfaces.pdf)

## Suggested tools:
- [Graphical Circuit Simulator](https://circuitverse.org/)
- Online Verilog Simulators:
  - [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)
  - [8 Bit Workshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/)
- Graphical FPGA Building Tool: [ICE Studio](https://github.com/fpgawars/icestudio)
- Get comfortable with the command line & Makefiles to run tools: GUI's are low productivity for coding.
