# FPGA_master_class

Hardware design and more narrowly, digital electronics forms the basis for almost all devices that modern society takes for granted. We believe in learning by doing and have put together a progression of topics as well as a curated list of resources to help students to get a quick introduction to the field. This is not a substitute for a more formal and deeper course that may be found at a University. Focus is on learnign by doing and getting an intuitive understanding of how things work.

This course is a self-paced, hands-on class and we hope that by the time you complete all the modules, you would have gained an understanding of how digital electronics works at a level sufficient to put together simple projects on your own. The course has a broad audience of learners from a typical high school level upwards.

The course was developed with community input and is a work-in-progress. Please create an issue or pull request if you would like to make changes to the coursework.

## Hardware

We will use the open-source [UPDuino](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/UPduino-v3.0) as the FPGA platform which you can purchase directly from [tinyVision.ai](https://tinyvision.ai/products/upduino-v3-1), [Lectronz](https://lectronz.com/products/upduino-v3-1-low-cost-lattice-ice40-fpga-board) (for EU orders) or [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/tinyvision_ai/upduino-v31-low-cost-lattice-ice40-fpga-board/).

The course material is not specific to this board however and can be used with any FPGA/hardware.

## Weekly Modules
The pace of this course can be varied significantly depending on your time availability and committment. Each module is intended to take a few hours overall to go through the reading material and also perform the experiments on hardware. Initial modules focus on providing the student with resources to get up and running on the hardware as well as environment setup which can be challenging. We will rely as much as possible on open-source tools to enable the audience to be as wide as possible.

The material should ideally be augmented by weekly interactions with a teacher/expert in the field. We plan to use weekly online AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) sessions following the format below:
1. Introduction to the upcoming topic
2. Real world examples of what the topic would be useful for to help students understand why they wouild want to learn the topic
3. Intuitive understanding of the topic where applicable
